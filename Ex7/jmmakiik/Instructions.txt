I assumed that the programs themselves aren't needed for uploading. And I also assumed that the
reader knows how to use the programs. I will only return files that were modified or are completely
new, and instructions that are needed to get the results wanted.

For the HDECAY first: Copy (and possibly replace) the files (hdecay.in, makefile and Runfile.job)
in my HDECAY folder to where your HDECAY program itself is. Then just write ./Runfile.job to do
everything needed. Then copy the br.sm2 file to the "Plots" folder returned here.

For the FeynHiggs: Copy (and possibly replace) the files (demo.cc, Makefile and Runfile.job) in my
FeynHiggs folder to where your "example" folder of FeynHiggs program is (FeynHiggs-2.18.1/example
for example). Then running ./Runfile.job in the "example" folder will do everything needed again.
Now, the program has produced the file "output.txt". Copy this file to the "Plots" folder also.

After running the two programs and copying the needed files to the "Plots" folder, then running 
the ./Runfile.job produces the wanted plots for the exercises.
