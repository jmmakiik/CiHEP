I have assumed that pythia8309 has been downloaded and configured by the reader (so there is no download in the Makefile).

Just move this file (jmmakiik) itself into the pythia file (as in the path for the program files
should be path/to/pythia8309/jmmakiik). Then by running ./program.job on terminal will run
everything needed. The Makefile is just for cleaning the file from outputs (running make clean in
terminal).

The program will produce a text file and a ROOT file including the results of transverse momentum
and pseudorapidity. Then the program will produce histograms for these two. Then the program will
also print the probability for exercise two.
