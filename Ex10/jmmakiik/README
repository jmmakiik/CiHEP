Just to note, this exercise was difficult in a way to change the absorber from argon to water. I
used the DetectorModifier.sh to change the absorber variables in the DetectorConstruction.cc file
in the Geant4 program. My files assume that the user has followed the instructions in the example
10 for Geant4. Copying the vis.mac and DetectorModifier.sh files to the file where you run the
./exampleB4a command should do the trick. Uncommenting and commenting as instructed in the vis.mac
and DetectorModifier.sh files will give you the wanted results when you input make and 
./exampleB4a.

The outputs of the program I have produced are attached to the solution. The geometry in both
cases is anternating between absorber plates (lead in default case or water) and detection gaps
(liquid argon) which are both square/rectangular (default dimensions). The entrance face of the
calorimeter for the beam is a square (according to one of the README files of the program). In all
cases, only one particle is being simulated and have 10 GeV energy.
